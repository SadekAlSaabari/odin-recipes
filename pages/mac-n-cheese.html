            <li>Cooking time: 15 minutes</li>
            <li>Serves: 4</li></ul></p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 ounces of macaroni</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of butter</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>2 cups of milk</li>
            <li>2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>Ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol type="i">
            <li>Gather the ingredients</li><br>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally for around 8 minutes (until cooked through but firm to the bite).</li><br>
            <li>At the same time, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat.</li><br>
            <li>Add flour, salt, and pepper and stir for around 5 minutes until smooth.</li><br>
            <li>Pour in milk slowly while stirring continuously. Continue to cook and stir until mixture is smooth and bubbling, about 5 minutes, making sure the milk doesn't burn.</li><br>
            <li>Add cheddar cheese and stir for around 2-4 minutes until melted.</li><br>
            <li>Drain macaroni and fold into cheese sauce until coated.</li><br>
            <li><em>Bon appetit!</em> You can add more cheese if you'd like, maybe half a cup or so, although not too much as it could ruin the recipe.</li><br>
        </ol>
